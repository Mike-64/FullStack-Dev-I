    <h1>Single Board Computers</h1>
    <p>
        A single-board computer (SBC) is a complete computer built on a <strong>single circuit board</strong>, with microprocessor(s), memory,
        input/output (I/O) and other features required of a functional computer. Single-board computers are commonly made as
        demonstration or development systems, for educational systems, or for use as embedded computer controllers. Many types
        of home computers or portable computers integrate all their functions onto a single printed circuit board.
        
        Unlike a desktop personal computer, single board computers often do not rely on expansion slots for peripheral functions
        or expansion. Single board computers have been built using a wide range of microprocessors. Simple designs, such as
        those built by computer hobbyists, often use <strong>static RAM and low-cost 8- or 16-bit processors</strong>. Other types, such as blade
        servers, would perform similar to a server computer, only in a more compact format.
